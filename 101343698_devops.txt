DevOps is a set of practices, principles, and cultural philosophies that aim to improve collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. The primary goal of DevOps is to streamline and automate the software delivery and infrastructure management processes, resulting in faster and more reliable software development and deployment.

Here are some key aspects and principles of DevOps:

Collaboration: DevOps encourages close collaboration and shared responsibility between development and operations teams. This collaboration helps in aligning the goals of both teams towards delivering high-quality software efficiently.

Automation: Automation is a central tenet of DevOps. By automating repetitive and manual tasks, such as code deployment, infrastructure provisioning, and testing, teams can reduce errors, speed up processes, and increase consistency.
